/**
 * Long-running smoke test for a compiled CLI binary.
 *
 * `--version` and `--help` exit via commander synchronously, before async
 * startup failures (e.g. the unhandled rejection from Parser.init when the
 * tree-sitter wasm load fails) get a chance to fire. This script spawns the
 * binary, lets it run for a few seconds, then kills it and asserts the TUI
 * actually rendered a known boot screen.
 *
 * The positive check matters more than the negative one: a "did the boot
 * screen appear" assertion catches *any* startup failure — known fatals,
 * novel error messages, silent crashes, hangs, segfaults that produce no
 * output. Negative pattern matches are kept only for clearer diagnostics
 * when a known regression recurs.
 *
 * Designed to run on every supported platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) without
 * extra deps. The binary doesn't need a TTY: OpenTUI emits ANSI escapes to
 * stdout regardless, and the static text we look for renders contiguously.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun cli/scripts/smoke-binary.ts <path-to-binary> [seconds]
 *
 * Exits 0 if a boot signal is detected and no fatal markers are present, 1
 * otherwise.

// Any one of these strings appearing in stdout/stderr proves the binary

// (not shimmer / animated) so they survive ANSI styling as contiguous
// substrings. Cover the multiple boot states the binary might land on:
//
//   - "will run commands on your behalf" — codebuff/freebuff main surface
//     header (authed + session ready)
//   - "Press ENTER to login" / "Open this URL" — login modal (no cached
//     creds — typical CI smoke)
//   - "Pick a model to start" / waiting-room copy — freebuff queue gate
//   - "Free mode isn't available" — freebuff country-block screen (CI
//     runners with anonymized-network egress like GitHub Actions land here)
//   - "Enter a coding task" — chat input prompt
