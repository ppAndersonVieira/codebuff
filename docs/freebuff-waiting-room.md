# Freebuff Waiting Room

## Overview

The waiting room is the admission control layer for **free-mode** requests against the freebuff Fireworks deployment. It has three jobs:

1. **Drip-admit users** — admit at a steady trickle (default 1 per `ADMISSION_TICK_MS`, currently 15s) so load ramps up gradually rather than stampeding the deployment when the queue is long.
2. **Gate on upstream health** — before each admission tick, probe the Fireworks metrics endpoint with a short timeout (`isFireworksAdmissible` in `web/src/server/free-session/admission.ts`). If it doesn't respond OK, admission halts until it does — this is the primary concurrency control, not a static cap.
3. **One instance per account** — prevent a single user from running N concurrent freebuff CLIs to get N× throughput.

Users who cannot be admitted immediately are placed in a FIFO queue and given an estimated wait time. Admitted users get a fixed-length session (default 1h) during which they can make free-mode requests subject to the existing per-user rate limits.

The entire system is gated by the env flag `FREEBUFF_WAITING_ROOM_ENABLED`. When `false`, the gate is a no-op and the admission ticker does not start; free-mode traffic flows through unchanged.

## Kill Switch

```bash
# Disable entirely (both the gate on chat/completions and the admission loop)
FREEBUFF_WAITING_ROOM_ENABLED=false

# Other knobs (only read when enabled)
FREEBUFF_SESSION_LENGTH_MS=3600000         # 1 hour
FREEBUFF_SESSION_GRACE_MS=1800000          # 30 min — drain window after expiry
```

Flipping the flag is safe at runtime: existing rows stay in the DB and will be admitted / expired correctly whenever the flag is flipped back on.

### Components

- **`free_session` table** (Postgres) — single source of truth for queue + active-session state. One row per user (PK on `user_id`).
- **Public API** (`web/src/server/free-session/public-api.ts`) — `requestSession`, `getSessionState`, `endUserSession`, `checkSessionAdmissible`. Pure business logic; DI-friendly.
- **Store** (`web/src/server/free-session/store.ts`) — all DB ops. Transaction boundaries and advisory locks live here.
- **Admission ticker** (`web/src/server/free-session/admission.ts`) — self-scheduling timer that runs every 5s, sweeps expired rows, and admits queued users up to capacity.
- **HTTP routes** (`web/src/app/api/v1/freebuff/session/`) — thin wrappers that resolve the API key → `userId` and delegate to the public API.
- **Chat-completions gate** (`web/src/app/api/v1/chat/completions/_post.ts`) — for free-mode requests, calls `checkSessionAdmissible(userId, claimedInstanceId)` after the rate-limit check and rejects non-admissible requests with a structured error.

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TYPE free_session_status AS ENUM ('queued', 'active');

CREATE TABLE free_session (
  user_id             text PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES "user"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status              free_session_status NOT NULL,
  active_instance_id  text NOT NULL,
  queued_at           timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  admitted_at         timestamptz,
  expires_at          timestamptz,
  created_at          timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at          timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_free_session_queue  ON free_session (status, queued_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_free_session_expiry ON free_session (expires_at);
```

Migration: `packages/internal/src/db/migrations/0043_vengeful_boomer.sql`.

**Design notes**

- **PK on `user_id`** is the structural enforcement of "one session per account". No app-logic race can produce two rows for one user.
- **`active_instance_id`** rotates on every `POST /session` call. This is how we enforce one-CLI-at-a-time (see [Single-instance enforcement](#single-instance-enforcement)).
- **All timestamps server-supplied.** The client never sends `queued_at`, `admitted_at`, or `expires_at` — they are either `DEFAULT now()` or computed server-side during admission.
- **FK CASCADE on user delete** keeps the table clean without a background job.

## State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> queued: POST /session<br/>(first call)
    queued --> active: admission tick<br/>(capacity + healthy)
    active --> ended: expires_at < now()<br/>(grace window)
    ended --> expired: expires_at + grace < now()
    expired --> queued: POST /session<br/>(re-queue at back)
    queued --> [*]: DELETE /session
    active --> [*]: DELETE /session<br/>or admission sweep
    ended --> [*]: DELETE /session<br/>or admission sweep
```

Neither `ended` nor `expired` is a stored status — they are derived from `expires_at` versus `now()` and the grace window:

- `expires_at > now()` → `active` (gate: `ok: 'active'`; wire: `active`)
- `expires_at <= now() < expires_at + grace` → `ended` on the wire (gate still admits with `ok: 'draining'`; client must stop accepting new prompts but can let an in-flight agent finish)
- `expires_at + grace <= now()` → `expired` (gate: `session_expired`; wire: `none` after sweep); swept by the admission ticker

## Single-instance Enforcement

The challenge: a user running two CLIs on the same account should not get 2× throughput.

The PK on `user_id` gives us one session row per user, but both CLIs could share that row and double up their request rate (bounded only by the per-user rate limiter, which isn't ideal).

The solution: `active_instance_id`.

1. On startup, the CLI calls `POST /api/v1/freebuff/session`. The server generates a fresh UUID (`active_instance_id`), stores it, and returns it.
2. Every subsequent chat request includes that id in `codebuff_metadata.freebuff_instance_id`.
3. `checkSessionAdmissible` rejects the request with `session_superseded` (HTTP 409) if the claimed id doesn't match the stored one.
4. When the user starts a second CLI, it calls `POST /session`, which rotates `active_instance_id`. The first CLI's subsequent request hits 409, so only the latest CLI can actually make chat requests.

The rotation is important: it happens even if the caller is already in the `active` state, so a second CLI always wins. Any other design (first-wins, take-over-requires-force-flag) would allow the attacker to keep the old CLI alive forever.

### What this does NOT prevent

- A single user manually syncing `instance_id` between two CLIs (e.g. editing a config file). This is possible but requires them to re-sync after every startup call, so it's high-friction. We accept this.
- A user creating multiple accounts. That is covered by other gates (MIN_ACCOUNT_AGE_FOR_PAID_MS, geo check) and the overall drip-admission rate.

## Admission Loop

One pod runs the admission loop at a time, coordinated via Postgres advisory lock. All pods start a ticker on boot, but each tick acquires `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(FREEBUFF_ADMISSION_LOCK_ID)` inside a transaction; if already held, the tick is a no-op on that pod. The lock is automatically released when the transaction commits.

Each tick does (in order):

1. **Sweep expired.** `DELETE FROM free_session WHERE status='active' AND expires_at < now() - grace`. Runs regardless of upstream health so zombie sessions are cleaned up even during an outage.
2. **Admit.** `admitFromQueue()` first calls `isFireworksAdmissible()` (short-timeout GET against the Fireworks metrics endpoint). If the probe fails, returns `{ skipped: 'health' }` — admission pauses and the queue grows until recovery. Otherwise opens a transaction, takes `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(FREEBUFF_ADMISSION_LOCK_ID)`, and `SELECT ... WHERE status='queued' ORDER BY queued_at, user_id LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` → `UPDATE` the row to `status='active'` with `admitted_at=now()`, `expires_at=now()+sessionLength`. One admit per tick keeps Fireworks from a thundering herd of newly-admitted CLIs.

### Tunables

| Constant | Location | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADMISSION_TICK_MS` | `config.ts` | 15000 | How often the ticker fires. One user is admitted per tick. |
| `FREEBUFF_SESSION_LENGTH_MS` | env | 3_600_000 | Session lifetime |
| `FREEBUFF_SESSION_GRACE_MS` | env | 1_800_000 | Drain window after expiry — gate still admits requests so an in-flight agent can finish, but the CLI is expected to block new prompts. Hard cutoff at `expires_at + grace`. |

## HTTP API

All endpoints authenticate via the standard `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` or `x-codebuff-api-key` header.

### `POST /api/v1/freebuff/session`

**Called by the CLI on startup.** Idempotent. Semantics:

- No existing row → create with `status='queued'`, fresh `active_instance_id`, `queued_at=now()`.
- Existing queued row → rotate `active_instance_id`, preserve `queued_at` (no queue jump).
- Existing active+unexpired row → rotate `active_instance_id`, preserve `status`/`admitted_at`/`expires_at`.
- Existing active+expired row → reset to queued with fresh `queued_at` (re-queue at back).

Response shapes:

```jsonc
// Waiting room disabled — CLI should treat this as "always admitted"
{ "status": "disabled" }

// In queue
{
  "status": "queued",
  "instanceId": "e47…",
  "position": 17,          // 1-indexed
  "queueDepth": 43,
  "estimatedWaitMs": 3600000,
  "queuedAt": "2026-04-17T12:00:00Z"
}

// Admitted
{
  "status": "active",
  "instanceId": "e47…",
  "admittedAt": "2026-04-17T12:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt":  "2026-04-17T13:00:00Z",
  "remainingMs": 3600000
}

// Past expiresAt but inside the grace window — agent in flight may finish,
// CLI must not accept new user prompts. `instanceId` is present so chat
// requests still authenticate; once we're past the hard cutoff the row is
// swept and the next GET returns `none` instead.
{
  "status": "ended",
  "instanceId": "e47…",
  "admittedAt": "2026-04-17T12:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt":  "2026-04-17T13:00:00Z",
  "gracePeriodEndsAt": "2026-04-17T13:30:00Z",
  "gracePeriodRemainingMs": 1800000
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/freebuff/session`

**Read-only polling.** Does not mutate `active_instance_id`. The CLI uses this to refresh the countdown / queue position. The CLI sends its currently-held instance id via the `X-Freebuff-Instance-Id` header so the server can detect takeover by another CLI on the same account.

Returns the same shapes as POST, plus:

```jsonc
// User has no row at all — must call POST first
{ "status": "none", "message": "Call POST to join the waiting room." }

// Active row exists but the supplied instance id no longer matches —
// another CLI on the same account took over.
{ "status": "superseded" }
```

### `DELETE /api/v1/freebuff/session`

**End session immediately.** Deletes the row; the freed slot is picked up by the next admission tick.

Response: `{ "status": "ended" }`.

## Chat Completions Gate

For free-mode requests (`codebuff_metadata.cost_mode === 'free'`), `_post.ts` calls `checkSessionAdmissible` after the per-user rate limiter and before the subscriber block-grant check.

### Response codes

| HTTP | `error` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 426 | `freebuff_update_required` | Request did not include a `freebuff_instance_id` — the client is a pre-waiting-room build. The CLI shows the server-supplied message verbatim. |
| 428 | `waiting_room_required` | No session row exists. Client should call POST /session. |
| 429 | `waiting_room_queued` | Row exists with `status='queued'`. Client should keep polling GET. |
| 409 | `session_superseded` | Claimed `instance_id` does not match stored one — another CLI took over. |
| 410 | `session_expired` | `expires_at + grace < now()` (past the hard cutoff). Client should POST /session to re-queue. |

Successful results carry one of three reasons: `disabled` (gate is off), `active` (`expires_at > now()`, `remainingMs` provided), or `draining` (`expires_at <= now() < expires_at + grace`, `gracePeriodRemainingMs` provided). The CLI should treat `draining` as "let any in-flight agent run finish, but block new user prompts" — see [Drain / Grace Window](#drain--grace-window) below. The corresponding wire status from `getSessionState` is `ended`.

When the waiting room is disabled, the gate returns `{ ok: true, reason: 'disabled' }` without touching the DB.

## Drain / Grace Window

We don't want to kill an agent mid-run just because the user's session ticked over. After `expires_at`, the row enters a "draining" state for `FREEBUFF_SESSION_GRACE_MS` (default 30 min). During the drain window:

- `checkSessionAdmissible` returns `{ ok: true, reason: 'draining', gracePeriodRemainingMs }` — chat completions still go through.
- `getSessionState` / `requestSession` return `{ status: 'ended', instanceId, ... }` on the wire. The CLI hides the input and shows the Enter-to-rejoin banner while still forwarding the instance id so in-flight agent work can keep streaming.
- `sweepExpired` skips the row, keeping it in the DB so the gate keeps working.
- `joinOrTakeOver` still treats the row as expired (`expires_at <= now()`), so a fresh POST re-queues at the back of the line. This means starting a new CLI during the drain window cleanly hands off to a queued seat rather than extending the current one.

This is a **trust-the-client** design: the server still admits requests during the drain window, and we rely on the CLI to stop submitting new user prompts at `expires_at`. The 30-min hard cutoff caps the abuse surface — a malicious client that ignores the contract can extend a session by at most one grace window per expiry.

## Estimated Wait Time

Computed in `session-view.ts` as a rough one-minute-per-spot-ahead estimate:

```
waitMs = (position - 1) * 60_000
```

- Position 1 → 0 (next tick admits you)
- Position 2 → one minute, and so on.

This estimate is intentionally decoupled from the admission tick — it's a human-friendly rule-of-thumb for the UI, not a precise projection. Actual wait depends on admission-tick cadence and health-gated pauses (during a Fireworks incident admission halts entirely), so the real wait can be longer or shorter.

## CLI Integration (frontend-side contract)

The CLI:

1. **On startup**, calls `POST /api/v1/freebuff/session`. Stores `instanceId` in memory (not on disk — startup must re-admit).
2. **Loops while `status === 'queued'`:** polls `GET /api/v1/freebuff/session` (with `X-Freebuff-Instance-Id`) every ~5s and renders `position / queueDepth / estimatedWaitMs`.
3. **When `status === 'active'`**, renders `remainingMs` as a countdown. Re-polls GET every ~30s to stay honest with server-side state.
4. **When `status === 'ended'`** (the server-side draining/grace shape, with `instanceId`), hides the input and shows the Enter-to-rejoin banner while still forwarding the instance id on outgoing chat requests so in-flight agent work can finish.
5. **When `status === 'superseded'`**, stops polling and shows the "close the other CLI" screen.
6. **On every chat request**, includes `codebuff_metadata.freebuff_instance_id: <stored id>`.
7. **Handles chat-gate errors:** the same statuses are reachable via the gate's 409/410/428/429 for fast in-flight feedback, and the CLI calls the matching `markFreebuff*` helper to flip local state without waiting for the next poll.
8. **On clean exit**, calls `DELETE /api/v1/freebuff/session` so the next user can be admitted sooner.

The `disabled` response means the server has the waiting room turned off. CLI treats it identically to `active` with infinite remaining time — no countdown, and chat requests can omit `freebuff_instance_id` entirely.

## Multi-pod Behavior

- **`/api/v1/freebuff/session` routes** are stateless per pod; all state lives in Postgres. Any pod can serve any request.
- **Chat completions gate** is a single `SELECT` per free-mode request. At high QPS this is the hottest path — the `user_id` PK lookup is O(1). If it ever becomes a problem, the obvious fix is to cache the session row for ~1s per pod.
- **Admission loop** runs on every pod but is serialized by `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`. At any given tick, exactly one pod actually admits; the rest early-return.

## Abuse Resistance Summary

| Attack | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| CLI keeps submitting new prompts past `expires_at` | Trusted client; bounded by 30-min hard cutoff at `expires_at + grace`. After that the gate returns `session_expired` and the user must re-queue. |
| Multiple sessions per account | PK on `user_id` — structurally impossible |
| Multiple CLIs sharing one session | `active_instance_id` rotates on POST; stale id → 409 |
| Client-forged timestamps | All timestamps server-supplied (`DEFAULT now()` or explicit) |
| Queue jumping via timestamp manipulation | `queued_at` is server-supplied; FIFO order is server-determined |
| Repeatedly calling POST to reset queue position | POST preserves `queued_at` for already-queued users |
| Two pods admitting the same user | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + advisory xact lock |
| Spamming POST/GET to starve admission tick | Admission uses Postgres advisory lock; DDoS protection is upstream (Next's global rate limits). Consider adding a per-user limiter on `/session` if traffic warrants. |
| Fireworks metrics endpoint down / slow | `isFireworksAdmissible()` fails closed (timeout or non-OK) → admission pauses, queue grows |
| Zombie expired sessions holding capacity | Swept on every admission tick, even when upstream is unhealthy |

## Testing

Pure logic covered by `web/src/server/free-session/__tests__/*.test.ts`:

- `session-view.test.ts` — wait-time estimation, row→response mapping
- `public-api.test.ts` — all status transitions via in-memory DI store
- `admission.test.ts` — tick behaviour with mocked store + health checks

Handler tests in `web/src/app/api/v1/freebuff/session/__tests__/session.test.ts` cover auth + request routing with a mocked `SessionDeps`.

The real store (`store.ts`) and admission loop ticker (`admission.ts` — the scheduling wrapper around `runAdmissionTick`) are not directly unit-tested because they're thin glue over Postgres and `setTimeout`. Integration-level validation of the store requires a Postgres instance and is left for the e2e harness.

## Known Gaps / Future Work

- **No rate limit on `/session` itself.** A determined user could spam POST/GET. Current throughput is bounded by general per-IP limits upstream, but this should be tightened before large rollouts.
- **Estimated wait is coarse.** Could be improved by tracking actual admission rate over the last N minutes.
- **No admin UI.** To inspect queue depth, active count, or kick a user, you currently need DB access. A small admin endpoint under `/api/admin/freebuff/*` is a natural add.
- **No metrics exposure.** Consider emitting queue depth and active count to Prometheus / BigQuery.
- **Session length is global.** Per-user or per-tier session length would require a column on the row; currently all admitted users get the same lifetime.
