# Codebuff Best Practices

Habits that make Codebuff more useful.

## Start in a Git Repo

Run Codebuff inside a git repo so you can track and revert changes.

## Leverage `.gitignore` in your repo

Codebuff skips files in `.gitignore`. For files you keep in git but want Codebuff to avoid, add `.codebuffignore`.

## Planning

Use `/mode:plan` to scope work before implementing. Codebuff gathers context, asks clarifying questions, and outputs a structured plan without touching files. Review and adjust the plan, then switch to default or max mode to execute.

See [Modes](/docs/tips#modes) for details on plan mode and other options.

## Include docs by link

Share URLs and Codebuff will scrape them to markdown. You can also drop links into `knowledge.md` so they load on startup. Useful for API docs, framework guides, or design references.
